Pepsi are not at all interested as the can is older than the 12 months shelf life they consider is reasonable. Having contacted Customer Service all they want to do is put the blame on everyone else, in their opinion it could not possibly be anything to do with them or their production process. I can only assume in their factories they they have never ever produced a part filled can of anything.Avoid anything to do with the Pepsi and Britvic brands if you want anything that would resemble decent customer service. Profit obvioulsy rules everything in the Pepsi organisation as consumers are the last thing they value.",

Personally I’d rather pay more for a full sugar drink, the health benefits of artificial sweeteners are increasingly being questioned by experts. All I know is that they make me ill. These days if I want a decent cola I buy Coca Cola. Pepsi needs to go back to their classic recipe pronto.",

In 2023, it generated $4.2 billion in revenue in russia, paying $135 million just in profit taxes to russia’s fully militarized economy.  When looking for a new advertising/PR agency in Ukraine in 2023, PepsiCo made it a condition for a potential partner to exclude any mention of the war, or support for Ukraine and its army in future communications.Pepsi is a great example of a morally bankrupt company that de-facto sponsors russian terrorism and war crimes. Pepsi has already been added to the list of international sponsors of war. Pepsi are sponsoring war crimes.",

The machine took my money and didnt give me a drink.  I called the vending machine place-Pepsi Equipment Service.  They told me I had to go online and fill out a form.  I filled out the form and pressed \"submit\" but my information didnt go through.I called Pepsi Equipment Service to complain and the operator offered to take my information over the phone.  I felt uncomfortable about doing that and I hung up on her.  They wanted all this personal information-when, where, why, date of the incident, my phone number, email etc.  I dont feel like selling my soul to a billion dollar corporation for $2.25.  Pepsico owns alot of other businesses besides just Pepsi.  I went online and looked up the names of those companies.I will never do business with Pepsi or any companies they own ever again.Thats a billion dollar corporation for ya.",

I just read a 2023 press release from Pepsico saying they were reducing sugar to improve peoples health and help the planet.  Since when are artificial sweetners good for peoples health and if Pepsico wanted to help the planet they'd replace plastic bottles with glass bottles.

They don't hold the actual bottles in place when u pick them up, but amazingly when u try to remove a bottle, the plastic just stretches in the wrong spot just mangling the plastic piece, and not actually releasing your drink. But it will loosen random holes making other bottles falling out. So you have the bottle u were trying to get, plus one other bottle, and others falling out randomly. Just like everything else pepsi does, they failed at this. Most of their products are subpar, and Coke makes much better product. The packaging for coke doesn't use the stupid plastic rings, it uses a reliable plastic wrap, and just like everything else, Coke has made better decisions. That's why pepsi is a failure compared to Coke, because every part of the pepsi experience is terrible, if they can't get the little things right, they will never get the big things right either. I've never seen a plastic that is so confoundingly useless as to not hold and hold your drinks too much at the same time. It's like some new technology that is guaranteed to fail no matter what it is trying to do. pepsi has invented a new process of abject failure that they have integrated into all aspects of their corporation, storeage to stocks, top to bottom, if it's not permeated by grotesque, disgusting failure, pepsi doesn't want it.",

I recently decided to treat myself and my Christmas guests to the classic delight of Pepsi Original, or at least that's what I thought until I unleashed the taste apocalypse upon my unsuspecting taste buds. I cracked open a can and was greeted by the unholy alliance of rancid artificial sweeteners and the flavor equivalent of a silent mime in a vacuum.Pepsi, oh Pepsi, what in the world were you thinking? Did someone spike the recipe with the tears of disappointed unicorns? This is an official decree: I will never, ever, under any circumstance, subject my taste buds to this travesty again. I'd rather lick a battery for kicks.I mean, come on! I want my cola to dance on my taste buds like a caffeine-infused carnival, not play hide and seek with flavor like it's auditioning for a role in a culinary horror movie. I'd rather swim in a pool of hot sauce than endure another sip of this abomination.So here's the plan: all 30 cans of this disappointment are getting tossed into the abyss, also known as my trash bin. I'd rather pay the full wack for something that actually tastes like happiness. Hello, Coke, my old friend, it's time to reunite. At least you haven't forsaken me with the taste of regret and sorrow. Pepsi, consider this a breakup letter - it's not me; it's definitely you. Change it back or lose me forever!",
