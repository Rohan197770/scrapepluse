I have been a customer of the bank since I was about 10 years old ( I am now 80), Wilke Lemon was the president of the bank when I opened my first account. It has been a great, lifelong financial relationship. I have heard horror stories about other banks, but I have never had an issue that wasn't resolved quickly and with the utmost professionalism. Much thanks to this bank for all of the financial guidance and assistance over these many years as a proud customer.",

I’ve had several mix ups when depositing at another branch due to another individual having the same name , I call them and it’s figured out within a few minutes. Awesome knowing you have people like that taking the extra time with their customers.",

I had just gotten home from a hospital stay a few days before the scheduled appointment. We went to the appointment but I was still not feeling so well. Long story short, Cathy could not have been more concerned and compassionate.  So much so that she came to our home the following day for us to complete the process  as opposed to requiring me to return to the bank on that date.  I so appreciate the extra effort on her part to accommodate  me at that time.  She certainly went above and beyond to take care of Friendship Bank customers.  I will be forever grateful.",

They went above and beyond and sent us a Kroger gift card for working with their insurance company and that really showed how much they value their customers.  We are 1st time customers with their company and will be customers for life!!",

I stopped to get gas one morning after work, put my card in and it said my card was declined, I had just gotten paid. I found out the froze my card from that gas station because they thought it was a fraudulent transaction.Then you go to use your card and can't because, gues what, you've already spent to much of your own money for the day. It's my money, I  need access to it when and how I need it, not how they want me to have it. We don't live in a dictatorship here.",
