The flavour is so famous, that it feels like every person on the planet knows how it tastes.

When I close my business, I had a $328.46 credit for returned tanks and full boxes. I have been waiting six weeks and still have not received a refund check. So this is poor business on their part they are sitting on that money collecting interest but when they delivered, I needed to pay them immediately to have the product I I am trying to close out my books and can’t because I don’t have the refunds all in to close them out. I have called them six times and got the runaround. This is poor customer service on their part. I drink about 12 to 15 cans of Mountain Dew a day. Don’t need to be judged on that. I have been a business customer and a private customer for 40 some years this is bad business would never deal with them with a business again.",

It’s honestly a tragedy that Sierra Mist had to be discontinued only for it to be followed up by a low carbonated and way too syrupy soda. No matter how many adds and brands you connect to a soda, a crappy soda, is a crappy soda. It’s certainly not the new or improved Sierra Mist, it’s the budgeted and over branded version of a Shasta mist(which I’d recommend over a starry).",

So much so that if you hold up a 20oz bottle to the light, it looks like a tea or just colored water. It's been a gradual process, as I'm sure you didn't want your customers to realize you were trying to sham us & skimp on the flavor and potency of your formula. However, don't underestimate us because we aren't that gullible & stupid. MANY of us have noticed even though most haven't took the time to post a review. Just a side note, we wouldn't mind paying a little more if your product went back to the original great product it used to be. And why are you using nanotechnology in your pepsi?",

I thought I must have got one dodgy bottle that was off, but it all tastes horrible! There’s no cherry flavour and it now tastes much like a cheap, draft diet cola when the syrup needs changing in a pub. I will definitely never be buying Pepsi of any kind again. Pepsi Horriblus! blah! yuck! Why on earth have they done this?",

I looked up the ingredients and surprise surprise it now has loads of artificial sweetener replacing the sugar.  If I wanted artificial sweetener I'd buy Pepsi Max or Diet Pepsi, but what irks me the most is that Pepsi didn't bother to mention or label \"new recipe\" or \"57% less sugar\" on their product.  I just read a 2023 press release from Pepsico saying they were reducing sugar to improve peoples health and help the planet.  Since when are artificial sweetners good for peoples health and if Pepsico wanted to help the planet they'd replace plastic bottles with glass bottles.  I'm going back to Coca Cola and never buying Pepsi ever again.",

They don't hold the actual bottles in place when u pick them up, but amazingly when u try to remove a bottle, the plastic just stretches in the wrong spot just mangling the plastic piece, and not actually releasing your drink. But it will loosen random holes making other bottles falling out. So you have the bottle u were trying to get, plus one other bottle, and others falling out randomly. Just like everything else pepsi does, they failed at this. Most of their products are subpar, and Coke makes much better product. The packaging for coke doesn't use the stupid plastic rings, it uses a reliable plastic wrap, and just like everything else, Coke has made better decisions. That's why pepsi is a failure compared to Coke, because every part of the pepsi experience is terrible, if they can't get the little things right, they will never get the big things right either. I've never seen a plastic that is so confoundingly useless as to not hold and hold your drinks too much at the same time. It's like some new technology that is guaranteed to fail no matter what it is trying to do. pepsi has invented a new process of abject failure that they have integrated into all aspects of their corporation, storeage to stocks, top to bottom, if it's not permeated by grotesque, disgusting failure, pepsi doesn't want it.",

Coca Cola all the way for me, they haven't changed their original recipe.",

I recently decided to treat myself and my Christmas guests to the classic delight of Pepsi Original, or at least that's what I thought until I unleashed the taste apocalypse upon my unsuspecting taste buds. I cracked open a can and was greeted by the unholy alliance of rancid artificial sweeteners and the flavor equivalent of a silent mime in a vacuum.Pepsi, oh Pepsi, what in the world were you thinking? Did someone spike the recipe with the tears of disappointed unicorns? This is an official decree: I will never, ever, under any circumstance, subject my taste buds to this travesty again. I'd rather lick a battery for kicks.I mean, come on! I want my cola to dance on my taste buds like a caffeine-infused carnival, not play hide and seek with flavor like it's auditioning for a role in a culinary horror movie. I'd rather swim in a pool of hot sauce than endure another sip of this abomination.So here's the plan: all 30 cans of this disappointment are getting tossed into the abyss, also known as my trash bin. I'd rather pay the full wack for something that actually tastes like happiness. Hello, Coke, my old friend, it's time to reunite. At least you haven't forsaken me with the taste of regret and sorrow. Pepsi, consider this a breakup letter - it's not me; it's definitely you. Change it back or lose me forever!",

I picked up a can of regular Pepsi, upon drinking it I thought I was drinking Diet Pepsi and double checked the can and discovered they have added Sucralose and Acesulfame K artificial sweeteners. So thanks to Jamie Oliver and his sugar tax, instead of having a drink with one unhealthy ingedient in the form of sugar you now have thress unhealth ingredients with sugar AND two artificial sweeteners. The taste is awful. I had a look on the Pepsi website and saw some pompous marketing psychobabble about how Pepsi has some initiative to inspire consumers to make better choices and to benefit people and the planet in the long-term. Well let me tell you Pepsi, you have succeeded, because you have inspired me to make a better choice and that choice is buying Coca-cola :-))",

However, since Pepsi changed the recipe to something which tastes awful and she wants a regular Cola, she has changed to regular Coca-Cola. Now, I don't like the sweet stuff and am more of a fan of Pepsi Max to Coke Zero. The problem is that enough people who bought the regular Pepsi but can't stand the new awful Pepsi and haven't gone, like the majority, to regular Coca-Cola are seemingly buying Pepsi Max to the extent that I can't get Pepsi Max so readily now and am resorting to Coke Zero! Indeed, my reason for writing this review today, is that our supermarket van delivery has substituted my Pepsi Max with the awful Pepsi which I have of course sent back for a full refund; even the van driver said pretty much nobody is buying the awful Pepsi and are sending back any awful Pepsi sent to them as a substitution for Pepsi Max. Would it not make business sense to stop making awful Pepsi and either bring back regular Pepsi or make more Pepsi Max?",
